# exercise1_learning
This package includes GUI simulations and demo scripts for learning stable non-linear Dynamical Systems (DS) from demonstrations using LPV-DS [2,3] and SEDS [1] approaches developed in LASA-EPFL.

### Running the gui for exercise sessions
- ```gui_lpvDS.m```: Brings up a GUI including all options in the above script + a robot simulation (as shown below) . 
*A guided video explaining how to use the GUI, can be found in this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fQO9Oluih0)*

- [Optional] ```gui_seDS.m```: Brings up a GUI including all options in the above script + a robot simulation (as shown below) .

### Using algorithms on own data
Within the [ds_opt](https://github.com/epfl-lasa/icra19-lfd-tutorial-exercises/tree/master/exercise1_learning/ds-opt) folder, we provide demo scripts for using any of the presented learning algorithms on test 2D and 3D data. These scripts are useful if you want to learn DS with your own datasets.
